## Process

* Tasks should be assigned.
* All the prensenter should be asked to prepare by Thursday, we will have a conf call for a rehearsal _sabha_ of about 15min.
* To have call of Pushpak and Sanket on status of if planning done or if any issue
* Thursday the rehershal day. Everyone should be given 2 mins to present what they are about to deliver in next _sabha_
* If someone wants to be absent on due to some emergency, he should try to arrange someone else, or at last ask _sankchalak_ to handle it.

#### Things to keep in mind while following the above process

* Everyone's time is precious
* Instead of going to Mandir for smaller task try to complete on phone
* If we took the responsibility, try you best to complete it
* End of the week, check if the _Sabha_ done as expected or not.
