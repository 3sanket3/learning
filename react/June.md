## Let's put thoughts into actions

#### The days which gave me chance to think deeper

Ronak and I started a company called [Red Software](https://redsoftware.in/) and even though we left the corporates as we didn't like their process of working, we some or the other way tried to follow the same after leaing them. May be because that's the only way we were by which we can get earning easily to at least to sustain our life (for me, the merried life). OR god may wanted to concreate the thought by more experience that we are not made up for it.

In the later March'18 (discussion started from 18th Match'18), we decided to take a step back. We asked our awesome exployees to find the job as we were discontinueing the model. And want to work fresh the way we left corporates, and decided _to focus on the quality work and not the quantity by expanding team_. It was really a tougher time for all of us to understand the situation and to gain confidence on whether our decision will be okay. Because we spent more than 3 years to build the team, to train and make the one who can replace our role.

Our many round of discussions with Sagar R., Sagar S. and Bhargav and our other dear once stated giving us the confidence as we were able to address many of their concerns. And where we were not able to, we just thought that anyway the new approach will give us our time back (freed from managing the team of juniors), we will surely do something to handle it.

_From the outside world, it looks due to the failure, people may loose optimism. But in the journey as an entrepreneur, failure makes you more optimistic for the other path_ At least I felt that, may be due to _failures are actually gaining. It gives us a knowledge about the things that won't work to reach the goal_. And for none of the goal, a straight and clear path is already known initially. So better we find the non-working path as soon as possible.
