# To spread optimisum

* A website on which I can write about the people, I know and their good things
* Shoould be on multi language
* Start with Gujarati and English
* May be possible that the same people may bad things/quality as well, but the defination of the website itself should be _see only the good qualities_ like Yogiji Maharaj said _Sadguno jova joie_
* this will potential audience may also have too may writes
* In Gujarati , I haven't found simillar , seems good idea
* Needs huge reading, follow them on twitter/ medium
* But I can also ask the people who are already good at writing, I can aks them to contribute
* Open up a wing - to consolidate the reading I get from motivational blogs
* Write about the local people - the people already know him/her may not be that impactful
* * the reader should be open
* * we can relate our life with them veru easily

- Invite people like Sailesh Sapariya
- There may be many such people who have such podcast or blog and want to share. i can put theoir articles and give them the attribution

* I can involve Darshini for this, as it will be great for her, she will be able to consolidate the her reading and optimism she is folloing right now.
* It will really be great if that works
