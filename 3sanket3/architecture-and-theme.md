## Architecture

Have two in mind

* React
* Gatsby JS (using React inside)

#### Explored

* Gatsby have an advantege of static site generation. On it's github page amny websites are listed built using Gatsby. React is one of them.

#### Unexplored

* As Ronak said, there are manuy difficulties in setting up getsby in Windows. So I have to give it a definate time and chek will it work
* Other option is ot setup linux as duel boot
* windows have some recent release to I will have to update it
* icon also dowload the Ubunt windows app

- How to use material design or any other woth Gatsby. How about to test it in two hours foolowing the standard doc

#### Status

* Material is properly integrated, I will go with GatsbyJS.
