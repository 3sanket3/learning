Hi All,

this is Sanket Patel(@3sanket3), a Java > C# > Angular > React > (many more coming ;) ) developer with 5+ year of experience. Little shy in the developer community and haven't interacted with many people other than friends around me.

From the start of 2018, with the tweet (https://twitter.com/3sanket3/status/947181853642973184) I started understanding the community, read a lot BUT now it's time to write and be more interactive.

I started my career with TCS (MNC in India) and left it after serving my contract as I don't wanted to do same kind of work all day being a part of a process. I started a garage company with Ronak Baldha (@fooburr) in Jan'2015 to develop software the way we wanted.

In addition to coding by now I have experience of hiring, firing, training, unbalanced work-life (yes, I am married!), having fear of 0 balance in bank anytime, wait for the payments for 5 months then go directly to client's office and stay 6-7hrs just to collect the dues(don't know the shorter phrase for this line in English), to make company comply with finance regulation and many more.

I will surely try share here and please feel free if you find I can help you with anything.

With excitement of joining,
Thank you!
