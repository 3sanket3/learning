#### Going offline

* * Will keep data offline
* * Will keep a generalized button at application level if there is anything in the appication that is unsynched to the cloud
* * Instead of electron we will go with _add shortcut to desktop_ chrome feature. (not found anything more useful using eectron for now)
* * ideally user should sync every day end
* * We may compulsury ask user to login everyday/one a week, so that we can validate the subscription
